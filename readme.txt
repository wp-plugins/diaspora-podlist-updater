This plugin periodically retrieves a fresh list of active Diaspora* pods and 
makes it available for other plugins to use.

== Description ==
This is an auxiliary utility plugin. It periodically queries Podupti.me, a 
public service of Diaspora* community. It retrieves a fresh list of active 
Diaspora* servers (so called "pods"). The list is then stored and made 
available for other plugins (specifically 
[Share on Diaspora](http://wordpress.org/plugins/share-on-diaspora)).
